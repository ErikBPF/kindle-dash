# Installing kindle-dash

Two halves: the **renderer** (a container on any always-on machine the Kindle can reach over your LAN) and the **Kindle** (a jailbroken device that fetches the image). Do the renderer first — you can point a browser at it before the Kindle is ready.

## TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ErikBPF/kindle-dash && cd kindle-dash
cp .env.example renderer/.env && $EDITOR renderer/.env   # set KINDLE_W/H, TZ, sources
cd renderer && docker compose up -d --build
curl -o test.png http://localhost:8810/dash.png          # should be a PNG
```

Then jailbreak the Kindle, drop `dashboard.sh` + the KUAL extension on it, and hit **Start**.

## 1. Renderer (container)

Requires Docker + compose.

```bash
cp .env.example renderer/.env
$EDITOR renderer/.env        # at minimum set KINDLE_W, KINDLE_H, TZ
cd renderer && docker compose up -d --build
```

It serves `http://<host>:8810/dash.png`. Open that in a browser — you should see the dashboard (panels with no configured source show a placeholder). See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for every variable and how to wire weather/agenda/usage.

> **The Kindle can't do HTTPS.** Its TLS stack is too old. Serve the renderer over **plain HTTP**. On a trusted LAN the published port is fine. To use a hostname / reverse proxy, keep a plain-HTTP `:80` vhost for the device — example in [`deploy/nginx-kindle-dash.conf.example`](deploy/nginx-kindle-dash.conf.example). (A browser will auto-upgrade to https; that's fine, the device keeps using http.)

## 2. Kindle (device)

### Prerequisites

1. **Jailbreak** — the exploit depends on your firmware; follow the current MobileRead thread for your model. You want a way to run shell commands (USBNetwork, or **KUAL + kterm**).
2. **A painter** — `dashboard.sh` uses the stock **`eips`** that ships on every jailbroken Kindle, so **nothing to install**. (It prefers `fbink` if present for nicer refreshes — optional: drop NiLuJe's binary at `/mnt/us/fbink` or set `FBINK=/path`.)
3. **`curl`** — present on most jailbroken Kindles.
4. Kindle and renderer on the **same LAN**.

### Confirm the screen size

The renderer must be told your exact resolution (it's set in `.env`, landscape — width ≥ height — and the device rotates). On the Kindle:

```sh
cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/virtual_size    # e.g. 758,1024 on a Paperwhite 2
```

Paperwhite 2 = portrait `758×1024` → set `KINDLE_W=1024`, `KINDLE_H=758`. PW3+/Oasis = `1072×1448` → `1448`/`1072`.

### Copy the files

Mount the Kindle as a USB drive (its root is `/mnt/us`) and copy:

- `kindle/dashboard.sh` → `/mnt/us/documents/dashboard.sh`
- `kindle/extensions/kindledash/` → `/mnt/us/extensions/kindledash/`

Edit the URL in `dashboard.sh` (or export `DASH_URL`) to where the renderer is reachable **from the Kindle**, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8810/dash.png?rotate=90`.

### Run it

Eject/disconnect USB first (USB-drive mode disables Wi-Fi and locks the filesystem). Then:

- **KUAL**: open KUAL → **Kindle Dashboard** → **Start**. (Exit and reopen KUAL once after copying so it scans the new extension.)
- **kterm**: `sh /mnt/us/extensions/kindledash/start.sh`

The clock updates every minute; **Stop** closes it cleanly (restores the screensaver). See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

#### `rotate`

The image is landscape; `?rotate=90` spins it to fill the Kindle's portrait framebuffer when you mount the device **sideways**. If it lands upside down, use `?rotate=270`. For a desktop browser, drop `?rotate=`.
